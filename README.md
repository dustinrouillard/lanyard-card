## Development Instructions

Working on these, using a tool called `yalc` to manage local linking to work locally, and nodemon to relink and add to the main app on changes.

Uses rollup to bundle everything together.

## Using the Example

The example needs a lot more work to be perfect, font is a bit messy and styles are a bit off, will fix up in the near future.
